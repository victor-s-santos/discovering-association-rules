>In this section I demonstrate how the algorithm works and what are its params.

* __Params__:

| __Suport__          | __Confidence__   | __Lift__            | __Length__         |
|-----------------|:-------------|:---------------:|---------------:|
| Support represent the frequency that respective item occours in the transaction| Confidence represents how reliable this result is  | Lift demonstrates how relevant the respective rule is      | Number of rules that are going to be returned|
